# Shape-Calculator

This App allows You to count Area or Circuit of chosen shapes.

You can choose the way You want to count it, from basics like sides' lengths to coordinates in XY graph.

Made with HTML, JS, CSS.

> Styling with CSS,

> CSS's specificity,

> DOM manipulations via JavaScript,

> Creating animations,

> Approaching problems in JS,

> Use of JS clousures,
